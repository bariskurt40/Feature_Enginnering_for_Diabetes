# Diabetes Prediction Model
This repository contains a Python script (Diabetes.py) for predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is likely related to clinical data, such as patient health metrics, and the model attempts to predict whether an individual has diabetes.

# Dataset
The dataset should be provided in the script or as a separate CSV file. It is important to ensure that the dataset includes relevant features for diabetes prediction, such as:

# Age
# BMI
# Blood pressure
# Glucose levels
# Insulin levels
# Skin thickness, etc.
# Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including:

# Accuracy
# Precision
# Recall
# F1 Score
